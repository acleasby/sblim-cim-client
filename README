About this Package
------------------
The purpose of this package is to provide a CIM Client Class Library
for Java applications. It complies to the DMTF standard CIM Operations over
HTTP and intends to be compatible with JCP JSR48 once it becomes available.
To learn more about DMTF visit http://www.dmtf.org.
More infos about the Java Community Process and JSR48 can be found at
http://www.jcp.org and http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=48.


Requirements
------------
In order to build, install and operate this package you will need a 
Java SDK or Run Time Environment of version 1.4 or higher, depending on
whether you build binaries from sources or use the pre-built binaries (JAR
file).

Sun Java SDK/JRE:
For users of the Sun Java packages, the following package is required to be 
adapted into the CLASSPATH environment variable:
 - xerces    http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j

IBM Java SDK/JRE:
Because the IBM Java packages includes already the xerces package, no further
requirements need to be resolved.

As a requirement for building the SBLIM CIM Client, Apache Ant 
(http://ant.apache.org) needs to be setup properly. We would like to recommend
a Apache Ant version 1.6.5 or higher. (Lower versions might also work properly
here)


Building and Installing the CIM Client
--------------------------------------
The build process is based on Apache Ant, so it is very easy to build the 
SBLIM CIM Client.

Running Sun Java SDK:
If you have a xerces parser included into your systems CLASSPATH environment 
variable, no further dependencies need to be resolved.
If you don't have a xerces parser included, please create a directory named 
'lib' in the 'basedir' directory of the SBLIM CIM Client. Please copy the 
'xerces' Java Archives (JAR files) into this 'lib' directory.

An Ant build.xml file is in place which supports the following targets:
  
  help          : This target can be used to display a description of the several 
                  targets.
  clean         : This target can be used to clean up the project from previous
                  builds.
  build         : This target can be used to build the Java classes of the SBLIM
                  CIM Client project.
  build-release : This target can be used to build the Java classes of the SBLIM
                  CIM Client project and also the JavaDoc.
  java-doc      : This target can be used to compose the JavaDoc for all SBLIM
                  CIM Client classes.
  package       : This target can be used to build a Java Archive (JAR file) 
                  which includes a Manifest and all Java classes of the SBLIM CIM
                  Client.
  release       : This target can be used to build zip archives and tar balls 
                  containing source, binary and documentation of the SBLIM CIM 
                  Client.
  cvs-update    : This target can be used to update the current SBLIM CIM Client
                  to the latest version from CVS.

The execution of the build process is very easy. Once, Apache Ant is setup 
properly on your system, just execute 'ant <target>' in the 'basedir' directory
of the SBLIM CIM Client. The output will be written into a new created
directory named 'cim-client'. That's all.


Using the SBLIM CIM Client
--------------------------
The SBLIM CIM Client is a Java implementation that can be used in all 
applications which deal with CIMOMs.
It is packaged into a Java Archive (JAR file) that can be consumed by other
Java applications as needed.

sblimCIMClient.jar:	This jar contains the core client with the SBLIM API

Additionally, the SBLIM CIM Client is also packaged as RPM package which can be
used in Linux Distributions to be installed. The RPM is based on the 
infrastructure that is defined by the JPackage project.
